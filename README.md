# movie_recommender

This Netflix-like project takes a dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and organizes the information to be viewed in a Django app. There are three dataset files of movies, their ratings, and users that have rated them. Currently working on implementing a recommender algorithm to compare users that have rated the same movies and recommend movies they would like.
